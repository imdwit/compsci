You are to write a short C program. The program will input two numbers: 1) number of miles to ship a
package, and 2) the weight of the package.
You are to compute the price to ship the package. The formula is as follows. If the weight of the
package is <= 10 pound this the rate is $10. If the package is over 10 pounds then the rate is $10 plus 50
cents for each pound over 10. In addition you are to add $5.00 for each 500 miles (or part of) shipped.
