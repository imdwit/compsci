You are to write a short program what will input two numbers (the numbers will come from the user) and then display the following output statements (you are to let C do the math for you):

1.  The numbers entered are val1 and val2 (val1 is the first number the user enters and val2 is the second value)
2.  va1 /  val2 = val3
3.  val1 + val2 + val3 = val4
4.  val1 cubed is val5
5.  val3 + val1 + val2 * 2  = val6

For Example:
The user enters a 10 and a 5.
1.  The numbers entered are 10 and 5
2.  10 / 5 = 2
3.  10 +5 +2 = 17
4.  10 cubed is 1000
5.  2 + 10 + 5 * 2 =  22
Once completed you are to attach your *.C version of the code to Blackboard.  DO NOT ATTACH a *.SLN document to Blackboard.  Do NOT ATTACH a project folder or *.SLN document to Blackboard ever.  Only attach *.c or *.h files.

Remember to attach your design tool.
