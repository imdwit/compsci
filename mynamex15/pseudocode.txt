Initialize an integer;

Make a for loop;
Assign that number to zero;
Since we want it to stop after 15 times, we set its exit condition to less than 15;

Since we're starting at zero, and counting to 14 (less than 15), it loops 15 times;

and each loop we're incrementing the integer by 1;

each time through the loop we printf('Dwight doane');

if integer is less than 15, loop again;

then after the loop exits we return 0;
